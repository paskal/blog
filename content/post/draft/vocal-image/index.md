TODO: less personal focus

I suffered from the very monotonic voice most of my adult life, sounding like I have a constantly clogged nose. I even had two surgeries fixing nasal septum, which I broke the first time at around four, and then two or three times more until the age of fourteen. Before I did the surgery, the problem was evident: my voice is monotonic because of the nose problems!

After the surgery, I could breathe easily, even during the cold, but the voice didn't change. For a long time, I dreamed of making my podcast, but I gave up. I knew for sure nobody would listen to me because my voice representation would be too unappealing for the listener to be engaged.

I talk a lot with my wife, and one of the topics we discuss is things we could improve upon, and one of the points she mentioned was my monotonic voice. No matter how interesting the information I am presenting, its orders of magnitude are less appealing than they could be because of my voice usage or lack of variety in it.

It sounded horrible: it would mean that no matter how much I would want to engage the listener or companion, I wouldn't be effective not because of my weak arguments but because of the voice's lecturer tone.

At the same time, it sounded too perfect to be true: clear definition of the problem I could do something with, with obvious benefit both for me and people around me. That way, an item "find a vocal training" ended up on my to-do list.

Around a month ago, my wife found announce of [Vocal Image app] (https://vocalimage.by/) on the author's [youtube channel] (https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCrdVSduTsWFIrMnKDAi2dQA). Full disclosure before we proceed: I'm using the app in Russian and don't know if it has a course in English already.

The app was advertised to "unlocking" the voice capabilities one has but don't use. I'm doing the exercises daily for around two weeks, and I see the effect: my voice consistently sound deeper and fuller than records I do before the workouts; I have a better feeling of my voice when I talk I started enjoying speaking.

The app provides a set of individual exercises with a video of coach Rusia (that's the coach name) explaining the technique and then performing them, and a text with a brief description of the exercise, its effect and method.

The second part of the app is a set of courses called "intensives" that combine exercises into a daily schedule with few days of doing individual ones and concluding them with a "combo" of repeating them all in a single session.

The last part of the app is videos explaining how the voice is produced, what possibilities do a person have with it (pitch, volume) and what areas the watcher should work on to unlock them.

When I first learned about this app, I started looking for alternatives because I wanted to allocate time into that effectively, and I found the following (both in English): [Orai] (https://www.orai.com/), which I would call "Duolingo of public speaking", and [Roger Love's course] (https://theperfectvoice.com/).

Doing Orai seems to be complimentary to Vocal Image as it focuses more not on the voice but on the speed and pitch of the delivery and lack of filling words like "uhm", "and so", *and so on*. Unlocking more possibilities of the voice with Vocal Image draws attention to how I speak, and Orai analysis of pitch and pace variety shows me precisely how well I use newly obtained capabilities.

I haven't started Roger's course, but it's worth mentioning nevertheless. Roger Love often called the #1 US voice coach, which might be true or false, but he is the #1 advertised English-speaking voice coach and seem to draw some love in forum discussions I found over the internet. As usual, you could find all the information he provides in different sources like free YouTube videos, but users seem happy to be paying for the guarantee of result, which he replicated over and over with world-famous singers over his long career.

I didn't have enough practice time to see the long-lasting effect, and I don't think it's possible to have it in such a short period. But now, for the first time in my life, I'm improving my voice, and I know that something impossible yesterday, like visiting a podcast or recording one on my own, will become possible with the practice. There is a long way ahead, but that's the road I'm willing to take.
