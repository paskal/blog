description: Planet Parade iOS game
title: Girlfriend experience

My girlfriend is working outside of IT, but had an interest in programming and started learning C# and Xamarin framework two years ago, and around that time she decided to create her own mobile game.

It was a long journey which changed her life in some way and soon will help her end up with the job of a programmer in another country.

The last step of writing a program is publishing it for the public, and I am glad to announce the game named Planet Parade is finally out for iOS and Android devices!

It's a [Mastermind](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mastermind_(board_game)) game with planets (*and Pluto*), it's source code in C# [available on GitHub](https://github.com/Ksinia/PlanetParade), and I encourage you to try it out:)
